# Mesosfer Starter Project for iOS #


A Framework that gives you access to the powerful Mesosfer cloud platform from your iOS app. 
For more information about Mesosfer and its features, see [Mesosfer Website][mesosfer.com] and [Mesosfer Documentations][docs].

## Register User
The first thing your app will do is probably ask the user to register. The following code illustrates a typical register:

```swift
// create new instance of Mesosfer User
let user = MFUser()

// set default field
user.email = "user.one@mesosfer.com"
user.password = "user1234"
user.firstname = "User"
user.lastname = "One"

// set custom field
user["dateOfBirth"] = NSDate()
user["height"] = 177.5
user["weight"] = 78
user["isMarried"] = true
user["myObject"] = [String:AnyObject]()
user["myArray"] = [[String:AnyObject]]()

// execute register user asynchronous
user.registerAsync { (succeeded, error) in
    if succeeded {
        // register succeeded
    } else {
        // register failed, show error message
    }
}
```

This call will `asynchronously` create a new user in your Mesosfer App. Before it does this, it checks to make sure that the `email` are unique. Also, it securely hashes the `password` in the cloud using bcrypt. We never store passwords in plaintext, nor will we ever transmit passwords back to the client in plaintext.

If a register isn’t successful, you should read the `NSError` that is returned. The most likely case is that the `email` has already been taken by another user. You should clearly communicate this to your users, and ask them try a different `email`.
